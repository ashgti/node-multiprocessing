This module is an attempt to add tools to Node for handling concurrency using
multiple processes. It is inspired by Python's Multiprocessing library. 

Current features:
* It can fork, which means it can run on 2+ separate cores.

More coming soon...

TODO:

* Figure out an IPC API
* Figure out a standardized way of handling interrupts and events in sub processes
* Figure out how to make this safe and fault tolerant 
* Windows API, it currently is very unix.
